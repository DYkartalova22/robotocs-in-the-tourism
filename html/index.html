            Tourism is a technology-driven industry. Tourists use booking websites, apps and social 
             media to learn about a destination and service providers there, plan, book and pay for
             the trips. Online Travel Agencies communicate with their customers through chatbots. 
             Hotel guests check-in with the help of kiosks and enter their rooms with magnetic cards
              or mobile apps. Robots deliver room service, clean floors, prepare drinks in bars and
               serve dishes in restaurants. Revenue management software supports hotel managers to 
               forecast room sales and set prices. Technologies permeate every aspect of tourism and
                hospitality.
