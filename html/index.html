        <br> 
         media to learn about a destination and service providers there, plan, book and pay for
        <br>
         the trips. Online Travel Agencies communicate with their customers through chatbots.

        <br>
          or mobile apps. Robots deliver room service, clean floors, prepare drinks in bars and
        <br>
           serve dishes in restaurants. Revenue management software supports hotel managers to
        <br> 
           forecast room sales and set prices. Technologies permeate every aspect of tourism and
        <br>
