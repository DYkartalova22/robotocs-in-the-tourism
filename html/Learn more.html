    <h1>Robots in Tourism</h1>
    <img id="right" src="../images/IMG_9409.jpg"> 
    <p>A robot is defined as a “programmed actuated mechanism with a degree of autonomy to perform locomotion, manipulation or positioning” (ISO 2021 n.p.). The term was introduced in 1920 by Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R – Rossum’s Uni- versal Robots. Robots are characterized by their autonomy and ability to sense and manipulate the environ- ment. Autonomy is “the extent to which a robot can sense the environment, plan based on that environment, and act upon that environment, with the intent of reaching some goal (either given to or created by the robot) without external control” (Beer et al. 2014: 77). A robot uses sen- sors to obtain data from its environment for iden- tifying objects, sound/voice, distance, location, temperature, power consumption, and communi- cation with other (robotic) devices. It uses a motor to move within the environment and actuators to transform energy into motion. A robot can affect its environment and interact with humans through screen, loudspeaker, robotic arm, and other devices. Robots can be classified as an industrial, service, or social robot based on their intended use. A service robot is a “robot in personal use or professional use that performs useful tasks for humans or equipment” (ISO 2021 n.p.). A social robot is a type of service robot intended to com- municate with humans. Based on their appear- ance, robots can be anthropomorphic (have a human-like appearance), zoomorphic (resemble animals), caricatured (have some exaggerated fea- tures), or they may have a functional design (look more like a machine). Service robots usually have functional design that is determined by the tasks the robot needs to implement. Social robots usu- ally have anthropomorphic design. </p>

    <h1 class="container">Application</h1>
    <img id="right" src="../images/IMG_9408.jpg"> 
    <p>The first robot-staffed hotel (Henn na hotel) opened its doors in 2015 in Nagasaki, Japan. From a supply-side perspective, tourism companies use robots to increase productivity, decrease costs, expand service capacity, create experience, improve service quality, and improve competitiveness and financial results. Robots are used for diverse tasks: provision of information, cleaning and disinfection, garbage collection, luggage carrying, delivering items (including room service), cooking, serving food and drinks, entertaining guests, and to provide physical distancing during pandemics. Their advantages compared to employees include 24/7 workweek; correct and timely work; easy expansion of their tasks through software and hardware upgrades; predictable service quality; and ability to perform repetitive, dirty, dull, and dangerous tasks without complaints. But their performance has limitations, as robots work in structured situations only; scope of tasks currently performed is not full, creativity and personal touches are absent, and the like (Ivanov and Webster 2019). The implementation of robots in a tourism company has simultaneously a substitution, an enhancement, and a transformational effect on jobs. The substitution effect is revealed when robots automate most tasks in a job position and replace employees. When robots help employees be more effective, efficient, and productive, they have enhancement effect. Through the transformation effect, robots change the nature of work for human employees. The decision to use robots needs to be preceded by a cost-benefit analysis. On the one hand, robots increase the capacity of a company to serve more guests with the same number of employees. They make operations planning easier, but the robot-based service delivery system is not very flexible. The use of mobile robots requires that companies have robotinclusive facilities. They can be used to create unique and memorable experiences for customers (Tung and Law 2017), and to stimulate guests’ positive word of mouth and revisit intentions. On the other hand, robots are expensive and are worth investing in if they improve a company’s bottom line by reducing costs and/or generating revenues. Leasing robots (“robot-as-a-service”) is a way for the tourism industry to offset the high robotrelated financial costs. From a demand-side perspective, tourists trust robots (Park 2020), have generally positive attitudes towards them, and (intend to) use them, although some customers (women, elderly) are less enthusiastic about robots. However, tourists perceive robots as cost-saving devices and expect discounts when served only by robots (Inavov and Webster 2021). Therefore, although robots may save costs, they may also save revenue to the tourism companies and decrease their profitability.</p>

    <h1 class="container">Future Directions</h1>
    <p>Although research on robots in tourism is gaining momentum, it is still in its infancy. Future research should focus on several directions. First, case study research has to delve into the economic aspects of robots and evaluate the actual substitution, enhancement, and transformational effects of robot implementation in tourism companies that have adopted robots. Second, research has to evaluate the contribution of robots towards a company’s competitiveness and profitability. Third, experimental studies can shed light on the prices that tourists are willing to pay for services that are entirely or partially delivered by robots compared to human-delivered services. Fourth, research should focus on the preferred humansrobots mix in the service delivery systems of tourism and hospitality companies. Finally, research can delve into the drivers of employees’ willingness to collaborate with service robots. From a pedagogical perspective, (under)graduate tourism and hospitality programs need to incorporate robotics as part of a broader course on technologies in tourism and hospitality. This is to equip students with the necessary skills to not only operate robots but to also design experiences (which involve robotic encounters) for tourists and employees alike.</p>
