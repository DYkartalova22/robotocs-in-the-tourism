        <h1>How technology will affect the tourism industry?</h1>

        <p>
            New technologies will affect every aspect of travel companies-
            from internal organization and management to how consumers will 
            perceive the company, the quality of the services it provides 
            and how it cooperates or competes with other companies in the 
            market. In a new reality, where services are provide from 
            machines, the roles of the participants in the whole process 
            will have to be significant change. Greater automation means a 
            greater role for consumers in the process of service because 
            now they will have to perform some of the actions themselves.
            The use of self-service technologies also transfers responsibility 
            for the start and the service from the provider to client- so 
            users are transformed into Prosmers ( = producers + consumers) or
            co-producers and consumers. The introduction of new technologies 
            will also require redrawing the service process itself- new 
            processes, activities, procedures, control, create new instructions
            to reflect the new way of providing the service, as well as
            so new way of planning the operational activity. And last but not 
            least, her robots automated technologies will improve the sustainable 
            side of the operational activity on environmental protection and
            nature. The use of new technologies will reduce the amount of 
            resources used, will there is less waste, it will be eliminated
            unnecessary actions will be consumed less energy and labor.
